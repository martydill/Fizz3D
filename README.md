Fizz3d
======
Fizz3d is a 3d engine capable of rendering Quake 3 maps.

Most of this code was written in 2002/2003, but in early 2011 I resurrected it and got it compiling again. This is the result.

In order to use it, you will need to extract the maps, models, scripts, and textures from the Quake 3 .pak files, and put the in the Bin folder, maintaining their folder hierarchy.
